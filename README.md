# BigDataAnalytics_MiniProject
A PySpark-based Big Data project analyzing road accidents across India to identify key patterns and causes. Provides insights through data visualization and predictive modeling for improved road safety.

#  Traffic Accident Analysis in India using PySpark    

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **road accidents in India** using **PySpark** to uncover patterns by **location, time, vehicle type, and weather conditions**.  
It focuses on **big data processing, visualization, and insights** to support road safety measures.  

---

## Objectives
- Perform **EDA** on Indian road accident datasets  
- Identify **key risk factors** and accident trends  
- Visualize **spatial, temporal, and condition-based patterns**  

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – India Road Accidents Dataset]
- **Size:** ~3,000 records × 22 columns  
- **Key Features:** State, City, Accident Severity, Vehicles, Casualties, Fatalities, Weather, Road & Lighting Conditions  

---

##  Key Insights
- Accidents peak in **early mornings and evenings**  
- Two-wheelers and cars are **most involved**  
- Poor lighting, rainy weather, and bad roads correlate with **higher severity**  
- States like Goa, Delhi, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have **higher accident counts**  

---

##  Implementation
1. Initialize **Spark session**  
2. Load and **clean dataset**  
3. Conduct **EDA & aggregations**  
4. Convert to Pandas for **visualizations**  
5. Analyze trends and **document findings**  

---

## Impact
Supports **traffic authorities and policymakers** in identifying accident-prone areas, planning road safety measures, and raising public awareness.
